      <h1>Standardized Tests</h1>
      <p>Applying to most graduate programs requires you to take a standardized test called the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). The GRE General Test measures your ability to answer basic math and English questions, which is something that most graduate programs require.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In addition to the GRE, you need to take the TOEFL (or the IELTS) exam if you belong to a country (like India) where English is not the official language. TOEFL is an English proficiency test to ensure you can adequately read, write, speak and understand the English language.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Your program or university may also require you to take the <a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about">GRE Subject Test</a> for your respective subject, however, this is quite rare.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It is important to score well on these tests in order to ensure that your profile remains competitive. A low score will drastically reduce your chances of getting into your dream university. </p>
